# Gravitational-Water-Vortex-Power-Plant
This script processes a video of a moving blade to calculate its rotation speed in terms of frames per rotation (FPR) and revolutions per minute (RPM).

## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to Austin, my senior at the University of Southampton, who played an instrumental role in making this project a reality. His guidance and support has brought this GWVPP project to a success.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed to run the code.
3. Replace `/path/to/your/video/file.mp4` with the actual path to your video file.
4. Run the script, left click hold and drag so that the blue square will fit the whole blade.
